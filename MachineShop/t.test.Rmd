t.test Paired t-Tests for Model Comparisons

#### Description

Paired t-test comparisons of resampled performance metrics from different models.

#### Usage
<pre><code>

## S3 method for class 'PerformanceDiff'
t.test(x, adjust = "holm", ...)

</code></pre>
####Arguments

* ``x``: object containing paired differences between resampled metrics.
* ``adjust``:  p-value adjustment for multiple statistical comparisons as implemented by p.adjust.
... arguments passed to other methods.

#### Value

HTestPerformanceDiff class object that inherits from array. p-values and mean differences are
contained in the lower and upper triangular portions, respectively, of the first two dimensions.
Model pairs are contined in the third dimension.

## Numeric response example
library(MASS)
fo <- medv ~ .
control <- CVControl()
gbmres1 <- resample(fo, Boston, GBMModel(n.trees = 25), control)
gbmres2 <- resample(fo, Boston, GBMModel(n.trees = 50), control)
gbmres3 <- resample(fo, Boston, GBMModel(n.trees = 100), control)
res <- Resamples(GBM1 = gbmres1, GBM2 = gbmres2, GBM3 = gbmres3)
perfdiff <- diff(res)
