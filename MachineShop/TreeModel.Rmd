TreeModel Classification and Regression Tree Models

#### Description

A tree is grown by binary recursive partitioning using the response in the specified formula and choosing splits from the terms of the right-hand-side.

#### Usage
<pre><code>

TreeModel(mincut = 5, minsize = 10, mindev = 0.01,
split = c("deviance", "gini"))

</code></pre>
####Arguments

* ``mincut``:  minimum number of observations to include in either child node.
* minsize smallest allowed node size: a weighted quantity.
* mindev within-node deviance must be at least this times that of the root node for the node to be split.
* split splitting criterion to use.

#### Details
Response Types: factor, numeric

#### Value

MLModel class object.
